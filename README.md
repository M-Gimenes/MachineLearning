# Machine Learning

I bought a new course on machine learning with python and will use this repository to store the activities I'll do throughout it. I organized it by modules, with subcategories within each one, with self-descriptive titles, and I'll update periodically.

## Course contents:
- #### Module 1: (Complete)
  Linear Regression, Logistic Regression, KNN, Naive Bayes and Decision Trees
- #### Module 2: (Complete)
  Recommender Systems, unsupervised learning and more complex algorithms, which use Ensemble methods, such as Random Forest, ExtraTrees, AdaBoost, Gradient Boosting, Bagging and SVM.
- #### Module 3: (Complete)
  Neural Networks, Deep Learning, CNNs, Parallel Processing, Frameworks, Image Processing and Computer Vision.
- #### Module 4: (In progress)
  Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), LSTMs, Time Series, Natural Language Processing, GANs, Reinforcement Learning, Genetic Algorithms, among others.
